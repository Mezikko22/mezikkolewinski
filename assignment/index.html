            I am Mr <strong>Obike Martins Chiemezie</strong>, and I was born on April 26 in Anambra State, Nigeria. My educational journey began at heritage heights nursery and primary school where i attained my first school leaving certificate followed by Marist Comprehensive College Nteje, where I excelled and graduated as one of the top students. Subsequently, I pursued a degree in Chemical Engineering at Anambra State University, Uli Campus, where I earned a B.Eng degree.Presently, i am studying Cloud enginnering at Altschool with ID number: <strong>ALT/SOE/023/3555</strong>.<br> <br>  
            I am the co-founder of WACCOL (West African Cladding Company Limited), a company that specializes in interior and exterior claddings and parametric features. My life is guided by the philosophy that determination and effort can overcome any obstacle. I firmly believe in seizing opportunities because, as the saying goes, "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take." With a strong work ethic and unwavering faith, I believe that the sky is the limit. <br><br>In my leisure time, I find enjoyment in playing football, video games, and closely following Liverpool football games and Lakers basketball games. I am a private individual and hold deep family values close to my heart.
